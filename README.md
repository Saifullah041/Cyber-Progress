# Cyber-Progress
This repo documents my journey through cyber security. Having prior IT knowledge, I decided to start with the  CompTIA Security+ certification. Consistency is the goal here. Let's see how this goes üòÖ.

### ‚ö† Starting off with something important that I learned at the end of this semester at my uni:
***Life is fair.*** 

You can only blame your circumstances and environment (instructors, grading policies, other external factors) when you have **tried your utmost best.** Only when you stop blaming the external factors do you realize that deep down, you know you could have **tried harder** and done better. But deciding that it is because of THEM or HIM or HER or IT, that one did not produce the expected results, is **the death of progress towards reaching your utmost potential.** 
Therefore, I must try my best and blame only myself for falling short of my expectations. 

## üìÖ 15th July 2025:
Today, I covered the first few sec+ exam objectives, which included:

### 1.2 Security Fundamentals
- [x] **CIA Triade**
- [x] **Control Types**
- [x] **Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting (AAA)**
- [x] **Gap analysis**
- [x] **Zero Trust**
- [x] **Physical security**
- [x] **Deception and disruption
technology**

(Yes, it says "1.2" because the Udemy course I am using to prepare for this exam is ordered so that it covers the 1.2 subtopics before 1.1.) 

### üìù Notes & Insights:
I made handwritten notes in a register to remember all the information. Thankfully, it was not a lot to take in, as I come from an IT background, it is easier for me to grasp these fundamental concepts. 
I also covered objective 1.3, "Change Management"; however, it's not solidified in my mind yet, for I have not jotted down my notes. I plan to do that tomorrow.
One thing that I noticed while studying these concepts is how closely some of them are related to business. As I have studied business studies in both my O and A levels, I was reminded of business concepts a lot. I am glad that these terms and concepts are not entirely new to me, and its making for speedy progress! That is only till I reach the more technical stuff and practical stuffüòÖ.

### üìà Next Steps:
- Make notes for objective 1.3.
- Cover objective 1.1.
- Update this documentation regularly.
