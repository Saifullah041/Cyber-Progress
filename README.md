# Cyber-Progress
This repo documents my journey through cybersecurity. Having prior IT knowledge, I decided to start with the  CompTIA Security+ certification. Consistency is the goal here. Let's see how this goes üòÖ.

### ‚ö† Starting off with something important that I learned at the end of this semester at my uni:
***Life is fair.*** 

You can only blame your circumstances and environment (instructors, grading policies, other external factors) when you have **tried your utmost best.** Only when you stop blaming the external factors do you realize that deep down, you know you could have **tried harder** and done better. But deciding that it is because of THEM or HIM or HER or IT, that one did not produce the expected results, is **the death of progress towards reaching your utmost potential.** 
Therefore, I must try my best and blame only myself for falling short of my expectations. 

## üìÖ 15th July 2025:
Today, I covered the first few sec+ exam objectives, which included:

### 1.2 Security Fundamentals
- [x] **CIA Triade**
- [x] **Control Types**
- [x] **Authentication, Authorization, and
Accounting (AAA)**
- [x] **Gap analysis**
- [x] **Zero Trust**
- [x] **Physical security**
- [x] **Deception and disruption
technology**

(Yes, it says "1.2" because the Udemy course I am using to prepare for this exam is ordered to cover the 1.2 subtopics before 1.1.) 

### üìù Thoughts & Insights:
I made handwritten notes in a register to remember all the information. Thankfully, it was not a lot to take in, as I come from an IT background, it is easier for me to grasp these fundamental concepts. 
I also covered objective 1.3, "Change Management", however, it has not solidified in my mind yet, for I have not jotted down my notes. I plan to do that tomorrow.

One thing that I noticed while studying these concepts is how closely some of them are related to business. As I have studied business studies in both my O and A levels, I was reminded of business concepts a lot. I am glad that these terms and concepts are not entirely new to me, and its making for speedy progress! That is only till I reach the more technical stuff and practical stuffüòÖ.

### üìà Next Steps:
- Make notes for objective 1.3.
- Cover objective 1.1.
- Update this documentation regularly.


## üìÖ 16th July 2025:
Made notes on the following exam objectives to solidify the information in my mind:

### 1.3 Change Management Processes
- [x] **Business processes impacting
security operation**
- [x] **Technical implications**
- [x] **Documentation**
- [x] **Version control**

### üìù Thoughts & Insights:
I wanted to take notes for objective 1.1 as well, but it's 3:40 am, and I need to sleep so bad üò≠. However, I think the content I covered was enough for today, as there were a lot of terms and procedures, and it was a lot to take in. I was confusing one with the other, but eventually I became aware of the differences, especially after doing the short quiz included in the Udemy course. 

Before deciding to document my progress, I had already covered up to exam objective 2.1, but had not taken notes in my register, and I am never satisfied till I do it. The reason is that it is a habit or way of studying that I have developed since my O levels. Concepts are not affirmed in my mind till I pen them down, even if I write down the exact same things as in the slides/notebook. I guess we can say that I am not a good auditory and visual learner, but at least SOMETHING works for me, even if it's relatively more time-consuming üò¨.  

### üìà Next Steps:
- Make notes for objective 1.1.
- Make notes for objective 2.1.
- Stay consistent, even if I cover less than planned!


## üìÖ 18th & 19th July 2025:
Two presentations, a quiz, and an assignment; these past few days have been quite hectic! The summer semester at my uni started off slow, but then it hit me with full force, taking up most of my time. Fortunately, I was able to cover up these topics:

### 1.1 Security Controls
- [x] **Categories**
- [x] **Control types**

### 2.1 Threats
- [x] **Threat actors**
- [x] **Attributes of actors**
- [x] **Motivations**

### üìù Thoughts & Insights:
According to my understanding, the topic of threats is perhaps the most important one yet. It gives the basis of how to think like the threat actors, trying to understand their behaviour through knowing their motivations and attributes. This type of thinking is especially crucial for a blue team role, which is exactly what I am aiming for. And I am quite sure that learning about threats, threat actors, and their motivations would be integral to helping me during my home practice labs (I cannot wait to start, but I must cover at least half the content before jumping into that!).

I am quite motivated so far. Things are getting more interesting as I move into the juicier stuff! "Vulnerabilities" is up next. It is rather lengthy, but I do not mind, as I know it is going to be the most practical topic till now, in the sense that I will be able to recognize vulnerabilities through different aspects and see them in real life.

 ### üìà Next Steps:
- Cover objective 2.3 (Vulnerabilities) 
- Rewise previous content (from 15th and 16th July).

## üìÖ 22nd July 2025:
- Revised all the previous content. Regular revision is very important as it keeps the concepts fresh, especially in the case of this certification, as it has a lot of terms and concepts to remember. 
- Started the vulnerabilities topic. 

### üìù Thoughts & Insights:
I am trying my best to stay consistent. Although I am not happy with the slowing down of my progress, I cannot help it either. University takes up much of my time, but I manage it fairly well. It's better not to rush this anyway, as I want to do this properly.

 ### üìà Next Steps:
- Finish objective 2.3 (Vulnerabilities).
- Manage and make more time for security+ prep. 

## üìÖ 25th and 26th July 2025:
I was so tired today that I just wanted to sleep as soon as I got home from a day out with the boys. But I drank a cup of coffee and spent almost two hours studying. These are the topics I covered in the last two days:

### 2.2 Social Engineering
- [x] **Human vectors/social engineering**
- [x] **Threat vectors and attack surfaces**

### 2.3 Vulnerabilities
- [x] **Application**
- [x] **Operating system (OS)-based**
- [x] **Web-based**
- [x] **Hardware**
- [x] **Virtualization**
- [x] **Cloud-specific**
- [x] **Supply chain**
- [x] **Cryptographic**
- [x] **Misconfiguration**
- [x] **Mobile device**
- [x] **Zero-day**

### 5.6 Security Awareness Practices
- [x] **Phishing**
- [x] **Anomalous behavior recognition**
- [x] **User guidance and training**
- [x] **Reporting and monitoring**
- [x] **Development**
- [x] **Execution**


### üìù Thoughts & Insights:
This part was not as hard as I thought it would be. I had prior knowledge of most of the vulnerabilities, for example, my instructor for the programming fundamentals course in the first semester at my uni had taught us buffer overflow in detail. "Race conditions" was the only topic that was kind of confusing to understand, but I was able to get it when the course instructor explained it with the help of sample code. 

Funny thing how I have learned about most of the social engineering topics through real-life experiences (and my dad's justified scoldings). These sections of the course were highly relatable and, therefore, easier to understand. 

One of the most important things I learned through these topics is that people are the weakest link in a security system. If a security system has layered protection and strong hardware and software firewalls, why would an attacker try to break through it when they can simply trick an authorized person into granting unauthorized access by obtaining sensitive information from them? Hence, the most crucial thing is to educate and train the workers of an organization very well, so that they can detect malicious activity and not get trapped. 

The next topic is types of attacks and their signs. I've read the topics and I am familiar with most of them, as I have covered them in my O and A levels computer science syllabi. 

My prior knowledge has helped me a lot till now, as I am plowing through these topics with little to no difficulty. But I am excited for the cryptography section. Sure, I have studied that topic multiple times in different courses, but it seems to be more detailed in this course as it's overall the lenghtiest section. 

(The Udemy course had objective 5.6 under the social engineering section because the topics were related to each other)

 ### üìà Next Steps:
- Cover Objective 2.4 (Attacks)
